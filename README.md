Analysis of data on California's 2010 cycle districts

I took 2010-2022 California approved redistricting plans shapefile and took data of 2021-2022 campaign contributions from the FEC to create a colormap for each district in California on the total amount of funding they received.
I also took data from Wikipedia and, using regex, I created another colormap indicating each districts two party margin for the 2020 House elections.
